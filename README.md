# RBM_BNN_for_MNIST
a simple structure to implement BNN 
  this NN has three layers,the first two layers are used to implement RBM,the third layer is a full connected layer.<br>
  While training the network,the codes update the weights between the first two layers of the network,then BP algorithm will update all weights.<br>
